# Agentic Commerce Sandbox

Learning and experimenting with agentic commerce protocols.

## What's Here

- **notes/** - My understanding of ACP and UCP as I learn
- **comparisons/** - How the protocols differ and overlap
- **demos/** - Small working examples

## Protocols Covered

| Protocol | Led By | Focus | Docs |
|----------|--------|-------|------|
| [ACP](https://agenticcommerce.dev) | OpenAI + Stripe | Payment & checkout for AI agents | [Spec](https://github.com/openai/agentic-commerce-protocol) |
| [UCP](https://ucp.dev) | Shopify + Google + Walmart | Full commerce interoperability | [Spec](https://github.com/anthropics/universal-commerce-protocol) |

## Why This Exists

AI agents are starting to shop autonomously. Two major protocols are emerging to standardize how this works:

- **ACP** focuses on secure payment delegation and checkout flows
- **UCP** focuses on broader commerce interoperability across platforms

I'm documenting my journey understanding how these work technically and what they mean for merchants and developers.
